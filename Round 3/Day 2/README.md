# Day 2 ðŸ˜ª

> *April 25, 2024*

- Reading the Frontend Dev Handbook in bed
- Took an lab exam at college (my question was about CSS)
- Learnt about React DnD, a library to make UI elements draggable. Gonna try it with my secret project!
- Studied about a few ways I can implement user login using JWT.
- Couldn't sleep for 38 hours straight! So, not much for the 2nd day...
