# Day 8 ðŸ¦–

> *May 3, 2024*

- Did a few extra things on my 2nd Frontend Mentor project, the [recipe webpage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm)
- It was really challenging to habe to guess the padding and other stuff from a simple low resolution picture of the design...
- Had a few academics related things to take care of, didn't do anythig else today...
