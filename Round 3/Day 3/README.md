# Day 3 👨‍💻

> *April 27, 2024*

(Couldn't code on 26th 'cause of academics related pressures...)

It's hackathon day!!! I got out of college in the noon, right after finsihing my exam, and rushed to the hackathon (called SusHacks). I was 5-ish hours late. But my team had already gotten there and started working their magic. Here's what we I the rest of the day:

- Helped my team solve the issue with `ngrok` (which I eventually gave up on)
- Wireframed one of the screens for the mobile application that we're building as a part of our project.
- Created a super cool concept for the whole project which I call, the David!
- Discussed about the Machine Learning stuff behind our project with my teammate.
